<h1 id="triangular-tradeoffs">Triangular tradeoffs</h1>
<p>Triangular tradeoffs are tradeoffs where you lay <em>options</em> along the sides of a
triangle, and you can only pick one corner of the triangle, leaving the
opposite side unavailable (it also works if each corner is an option and you
need to pick one side). You can construct a triangular trade-off with the
template sentence <code>A,B,C - pick two</code> (or pick <span class="emoji" data-emoji="two">2️⃣</span>).</p>
<p>Examples of triangular tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">Consistent, Available, Partition-Tolerant</a> – pick <span class="emoji" data-emoji="two">2️⃣</span>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Good, Fast, Cheap</a> – pick <span class="emoji" data-emoji="two">2️⃣</span>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ricardoandlorena.com/lifestyle/money-time-energy">Energy, Money, Time</a> – pick <span class="emoji" data-emoji="two">2️⃣</span>
</li>
<li><a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/docs/fulfillment/">Joy, Skill, Needs</a> –  pick <span class="emoji" data-emoji="two">2️⃣</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably have encountered such sentence because triangular tradeoffs arise
in many context. The first one is the CAP-Theorem: an impossibility result in
computer science. The second one is a form of project-management gimmick.
Whereas the two last ones are motivational frameworks to help us go on with our
lives (and to be honest to the article, the last one encourages to pick
<span class="emoji" data-emoji="three">3️⃣</span>).</p>
<p>These tradeoffs have the same structure and thus, which is why we recognize them as a triangle.</p>
<h2 id="modeling-triangular-tradeoffs">modeling triangular tradeoffs</h2>
<p>The most direct representation of triangular tradeoffs is, well, to have a
triangle: pick a single corner or a single side. One thing to node is that when
picking a side of a triangle, we actually chose an option that is explicitly
characterized along two desireable criteria (e.g., Good and Cheap) while
implicitly leaving out the third criteria (i.e., not Fast).  The fact that
criteria are independant of each other is in contrast with tradeoffs which are
enunciated as “Cheap or Expensive” because Expensive some is the opposite of
Cheap whereas Expensive and Cheap are not related to Good or Bad.</p>
<p>The key observation to make here is that each of the three options actually
encode a <em>combination of independant criteria</em>: goodness (Good or not), cost
(Cheap or not), and time-to-delivery (Fast or not). If we give a numerical
representation to each criteria, say <code>1</code> represents Good and <code>0</code> represents
not-Good (and same for Cheap and Fast). We can then use a three-digit number like
<code>011</code> (not-Good, Cheap, Fast) to represent various positions on the triangle.</p>
<p>If we step back, the “option” we pick when taking a side of the tradeoff
triangle is slightly different from the “option” we pick when deciding to pick
a <em>value</em> in the <em>domain</em> of a given criteria. Indeed, the first kind of option
picks three digits, whereas the second kind of option picks a single digit.
However, the two kinds of “options” are related as the values that either
<em>variables</em> can take are bound together each other via the triangle constraint.</p>
<p>With binary values to represent each of the three possible criteria, we have
eight possible choices to assign. If we read “a,b,c – pick 2” we could encode
the constraint as: <code>pick one of 011, 110, 101</code>. If we step back, and we said
that we meant “pick a corner”, this. Thus, the way we chose to model variables
will affect the way we <em>express</em> constraints. Sometimes you can get shortcuts
like using a single variable with fewer choice than all the combinations of the
components’ domain. However such shortcuts may lose applicability or be to
distant from reality.</p>
<p>It is often useful to challenge our modeling in this way, because for the four
examples of Triangle tradeoffs I gave, we indeed have some notion of “at best
pick two” and “worst case pick zero”.  In reality, you can totally have some
project that are nor good, nor fast, nor cheap (i.e., <code>000</code>). Let’s call them
industrial disasters (e.g., <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/18243/lidl-cancels-sap-introduction-having-sunk-500-million-into-it">Lidl’s botched
SAP</a>).
Indeed, abandoning Money will not magically give you Energy and Time. The
reality we want to capture with this triangle is more something around if you
want more Money you will lose-out on Time or Energy.  As a result, the Triangle
constraint could be better expressed as <code>111 is invalid</code>.</p>
<p>Further, in reality each of the criteria are more subtle than having Money or
not having Money. Money is literally an account that can take ranges of values
(you could also have negative Money if you owe someone) and hence a <code>0-1</code>
variable is not sufficient to express the subtlety of life experiences.  Where
I want to bring you is that we need some more granularity when expressing
tradeoffs.</p>
<h1 id="tradeoffs-on-ranges">Tradeoffs on Ranges</h1>
<p>We can give a weight, as a scalar value, for each of the binary choice. Rather
than limiting ourselves to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> we can pick more granular values,
which allow to express more nuance between choices. For instance, let’s stay we
can give a value in the <code>[0 ... 100]</code> interval, where <code>0</code> is the equivalent of
<code>false</code> and <code>100</code> it the equivalent of <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>We now are equipped with something that allows to <em>quantify</em> how much we are
situated in the <em>design space</em>.</p>
<p><em>the key thing is to realize that when mapping options we are actually defining a dimensional range and giving a name to one end of the range</em> thus concise is the opposite of thorough: they live in a same dimension;</p>
<p>things like monolith vs. microservices are not tradeoffs in the sense that they are presented as options and their outcomes are in other dimensions, but they are tradeoffs because there is more granularity in the choice</p>
<h1 id="going-further">Going further</h1>
<p>You are free to encode mapping between physically measurable quantities as long
as the mapping have some reasonable assumptions (in particular, some form of
monotonicity and maybe some continuity).</p>
<h2 id="monotonicity">monotonicity</h2>
<p>In general, when modeling a value for a tradeoff, there are two extremes for
<code>bad</code> and <code>good</code> along an axis (e.g., fast is zero and slow is infinite). What
you want to avoid are forms of functions that contain regression (e.g., taking
3 months being measured faster than taking 1 month). In such a situation your
model loses applicability (and probably resolution) because somehow some
phenomenon is inconsistent with our human-made understanding.</p>
<h2 id="continuity-or-lack-of">continuity or lack-of</h2>
<p>Functions you pick could be discontinuous (e.g., a natural number between 0 and
100) or (e.g., a real number between 0.0 and 100.0).  When using a computer for
picking a tradeoff, for performance and practical reason, you’ll get truncated
values (Real numbers are … not really tangible to be fair and I’m digressing
but I feel they are not “really” numbers, I  prefer to call them limits)</p>
<h1 id="going-even-further">Going even further</h1>
<p>You are free to use a constraint an outcome to some minimal value.
Here we are blurring the lines between:</p>
<ul>
<li>modifying the current model to take more things into account
</li>
<li>using an output of the current model as a modeling basis for another model
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, this approach can be useful in to iteratively model a system in
increasingly high-level stages. Sometimes a first analysis will reveal some
analytical form (i.e., you can take shortcuts when deciding to map physical
values to decision dimensions).</p>
