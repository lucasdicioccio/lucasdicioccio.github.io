<p>Prometheus-monitor is a low-configuration web application. Run
Prometheus-Monitor to inspect data from services which expose metrics in the
<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus-format</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intended-use-cases">Intended use cases</h2>
<p>Whether you are a developer running software locally or an <a href="/hashtags/SRE.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="SRE">#SRE</span></a> investigating
production hiccups, you sometimes need to inspect how a specific job behaves.</p>
<p>If you organization is mature, services probably provide logs and metrics that
you collect and expose in a dashboard. In some situations, however, such
platforms may feel too limited or too vast. In particular, monitoring platforms
are meant to aggregate information across jobs and across time. Thus if your
problem is to identify how a single job operates at short time-scale you may
feel limited or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>If you are a developer you likely find that configuring a whole metrics and
dashboard infrastrucure is too much overhead for development purposes. As a
results, counters rarely get added and low-hanging fruits around monitoring are
missed.  Rightfully, developers find a low return-on-efforts to pro-actively
add metrics while developing new features.</p>
<p>Prometheus-monitor’s primary goal is to address such niche use cases where you
need or want to focus on individual jobs or individual metrics. In particular,
it is useful when your diagnostics have little repetition from one situation to
another: point it to <code>/metrics</code> endpoints and you get some live graphs to see.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-it">How to run it?</h2>
<p>Prometheus-Monitor is a JavaScript application running in a web-browser. As
such the requirements on Prometheus-Monitor are pretty low. However,
web-browsers are sanboxed and limit what queries a page can send. In our case,
the caveat is that if the JavaScript runs in a web-page: HTTP GET queries to
Prometheus endpoints are subject to CORS authorizations (this is the reason why
I enable CORS on the /metrics endpoint of
<a href="https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/prodapi">prodapi</a> applications). The
recommended way to circumvent CORS is to install the application as a browser
extension.</p>
<h3 id="firefox-extension-recommended">Firefox extension (recommended)</h3>
<p><strong>note: I haven’t yet upgraded the extension to the new UI</strong></p>
<p>You can install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/prometheus-monitor/">Firefox extension</a>.
An icon appears in your extension toolbar, press-it and it will open a static
HTML page with the application JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="chrome-extension">Chrome extension</h3>
<p>The submission and review process for Chrome is longer than for Firefox. My
extension is currently in review. Once (if) approved, the usage will be the same as for Firefox.</p>
<h3 id="directly-in-the-browser-on-localhost-via-a-proxy">Directly in the browser on localhost via a proxy</h3>
<p>Albeit browsers typically disallow cross-origin calls on the Internet, you may
get lucky with <code>/metrics</code> pages running on you <code>localhost</code>. Therefore: when
developing locally you can use the web browser (my typical use case), or you
can likely use install some form of proxy (running locally or allowing CORS).</p>
