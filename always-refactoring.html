<p>This article is the second in a series of articles on refactoring.</p>
</div>
<p>From a non-developer viewpoint, it may be hard to connect with developers who
are <strong>always refactoring</strong>. I wrote this article to fill a gap I noticed during
multiple discussions with non-technical stakeholders: some stakeholders have
the feeling that tech teams are “always refactorin’”.  Depending on the type of
relationships between developers and other roles, the question whether to
refactor or not can become a point of acute tension.</p>
<h1 id="refactoring-to-support-project-scope-changes">Refactoring to support <a href="/hashtags/project-scope.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="project-scope">#project-scope</span></a> changes</h1>
<p>Let’s recollect what we introduced in the <a href="/what-is-the-project-scope.html">previous article about project
scopes</a> and the <a href="/scope-explorer.html">complementary
toy-application</a>. As software projects grow, we
accumulate code to enable features.</p>
<p>When a new feature is required, we are faced with an easy decision: pause
in-progress work and prioritize on new features or continue on what is in
progress. Conversely, when a new technical or process requirement pops-up, we
are faced with more difficult decisions: we need to revisit everything in scope
that has been shipped already. A decision to implement or postpone is required
for each individual feature already shipped and in scope. Typically, one can
live with some gaps for some time (e.g., missing tests, hardcoded parameters,
outdated libraries, manual approval in an otherwise automated process, un-even
edge-case coverages for two flavors of a same system). However, at some point
the infamous <em>technical debt</em> weighs too much and a feature can be considered
unfinished. In short, as requirements pile-up there is some risk that your
<strong>effective coverage reduces even though the amount of delivered tasks
increases</strong>, an effect that I refer to as a <em>coverage cave-in effect</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/project-scope-timeline.png" alt="scope can suffer from cave-in" /></p>
<p>Refactoring is an attempt at mitigating cave-ins for upcoming requirements.
The mitigation can be either anticipated or reacted-upon. If you anticipated,
you do not observe the “cave-in” gap but the totalled amount of refactoring
work incurs some delay.  If the refactoring work is reactive you get to do the
same amount of work anyway, except that you do it while your effective coverage
is reduced. Overall, engineers tend to like refactors: they will recognize the
risks of cave-ins and will often express the need to “refactor first”.  As
refactor are pushed in the future engineers keep discussing the need to
refactoring. When the refactoring starts, it takes longer than expected and
leaves even more extra work. Overall, I have witnessed, and I can see a number
of scenarios in which product managers grow the feeling that engineers are
always refactoring.</p>
<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a technical task and a technical challenge: change how a
component operates without affecting the external behavior.  People obsessed
with “customer value” raise eyebrows because a refactor brings “no value” to a
product. Pedantic engineers will note that <strong>business value is not only
customer value</strong>. Indeed, engineers do not refactor for the desire of
challenges: engineers refactor to reach a more favorable state than from where
they started.</p>
<p>Examples of goals for refactors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>uniformize some idioms in a code-base so that (e.g., when merging two implementations from two different maturity levels a your product)
</li>
<li>keep an acceptable pain-level for people who need to maintain or operate the system
</li>
<li>prepare for planned ulterior scope changes (e.g., in order to internationalize a service)
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first example, the value resides in paying-up some “tech debt”.  In the
second example, the value is pairwise: liberate resources for higher-value
tasks and improve the satisfaction of team members (employee churn is an active
threat to teams’ success).  Finally, the third example is merely time-shifting
future work into the present, without changing much the actual customer value.</p>
<p>Among engineers, some purely-technical tasks like “changing the logging format”
may not be recognized as “a honest to god refactor”. Somehow, as far as our
discussion is concerned, and as far as engineer-product communication goes, the
decisive characteristics we care about is the absence of customer-value.  The
“refactoring” label merely is a shorthand for how to classify this task: it
takes work but if you are not an engineer you need not know how the sausage is
made.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding the goal of a refactoring task may lead to some <em>breach of
trust</em> between product and engineering <span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span>.  The main catch is:
developers’ happiness and morale are part of their productivity and you have an
incentive and some moral obligation to create virtuous cycles rather than
self-defeating feedback loops.</p>
<h1 id="i-believe-my-team-is-always-refactoring-what-should-i-do">I believe my team is always refactoring what should I do?</h1>
<p>Now that background is setup, let start the real discussion. You are in a
frustrating situation where the team delivery feels slow, and engineers seem to
do refactoring over refactoring.</p>
<h2 id="first-is-it-really-true">First, is it really true?</h2>
<p>In all companies, you need to settle on some acceptable amount of technical
work, which includes refactors.  In a sense, it is the “cost of doing
business”. A fork of accepted technical work varies from 20% to 50% of
technical work .  The proportion you
observe should probably fluctuate within this range and could deviate more
depending on the erratic aspects of companies’ timelines.</p>
<p>However, a team deviating for too long may be a reason for concern: too little
technical work probably means you are post-poning tasks you should have done
already, too much time spent on technical work may mean your team lacks
purposeful tasks or maybe they are circling and figuring things out (in the
latter case, they need hindsights from senior engineers/architects).</p>
<p><img src="/images/always-refactoring-tunnel-01.jpeg" alt="technical work acceptable band" /></p>
<p>As illustrated in the above picture, if you plot the fraction of work spent
along time, you should expect some team to stay in the 20-50% band. In this
example, the green-plain line is okay, the two dashed-lines probably deserve
some investigation. The 20%-50% bracket is more a rule of thumb speaking from
experience (personal, colleagues, also a <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1568665141662851073">recent Twitter poll I made in preparation of this
article</a>) than anything.</p>
<p>One caveat here is that you need some fair assessment of how much engineer time
is taken by refactorings.  From experience, I’ve seen that it may be
challenging for tech leaders to provide such a fair assessment.  Without
turning this post into some advertisment, <a href="https://www.echoeshq.com/">my current
company</a> provides a service to solve this question
among many other questions.</p>
<p>Now, assuming that you have legitimate concerns regarding some refactoring work,
let’s discuss the <em>timing of refactoring</em>. Then we’ll discuss avenues to
challenge and <em>push back</em> a team member who wants to refactor something when you
think there are better things to do.</p>
<h2 id="the-timing-of-the-refactoring-is-key">The timing of the refactoring is key</h2>
<p>Project planning, sprint sessions, and similar corporate ceremonies are venues
where teams discuss the need for refactorings. Alas, no-one is encitivized to
tell the truth in such ceremonies: time or complexity estimates always are
fudged and a complex meta-game between makers and askers happens around
roadmaps. Such ceremonies deserve better. If your teams are always refactoring,
you have likely witness a heated discussion when a developer brings up a
refactoring task. In this situation, it is a good idea to keep in mind that
developers will bring up refactoring tasks for a reason, and in general to
avoid some functional cave-in.</p>
<p>Refactorings exist mostly to prevent some form of looming or occurred
functional cave-in. Thus you cannot get a lot of information by challenging
“why” people refactoring. A more interesting characteristics for a refactor is
the question of “when”. A refactor can be preliminary work, wrap-up work, or
intermediary work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>As preliminary work</em>. Most features benefit from chunking into many small tasks.
Preliminary refactors (e.g., moving all functions into some common umbrella
module) are easy to plan and scope ahead of time. Consider these as stepping
stones reducing the risk of a particular delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As wrap-up work</em>. One may consider a feature unfinished from a technical
standpoint while it is already delivering on a functional standpoint. It is
common to deploy some Proof of Concept early to test a feature. These Proof of
Concept often are “too large”. The hindsight gained from running a system is
light shedding. Engineers will find flaws and limitations in their system that
would have been better handled in other ways. I would advise budgetting some
time to perform such wrap-up as engineers still have a lot of working knowledge
of the code. On the opposite, moving onto to new features in a haste with no
time to wrap-up is a longer-term risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>As intermediary work</em>. The fractal nature of projects’ scopes and the
erratic nature of scope discovery ensure that hiccups occur. Some severe
obstacle may pop-up while implementing some feature (e.g., a third-party API
exhibits severe rate-limitations on an endpoint you used to rely on and you
need to pass some cache in a whole slice of code, adapt tests and so on). You
may not be aware of most of these refactors as small refactors occur as part of
the normal flow of development. Incredible delays may occur when the larger
system or infrastructure require changes. A way to rationalize these
intermediary refactors is to consider them preliminary or wrap-up of some
subtask.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, in the bad cases, for one single feature, team members may argue three
times in favour of refactoring.  Given that many features are discussed in
ceremonies, engineers may come across as people who are always refactoring.</p>
<p>At this point, I mostly gave arguments in favor of refactor: they tend to go in
the right direction. The real issue of refactoring is that they take up time
from other concerns. Thus, if you feel like your team is always refactoring,
the main problem is the one of arbitraging against other topics. You have two
main ways to reduce the “refactoring-tax”: one one hand you can push-back on
refactoring, on the other hand you can reduce the prevalence of refactoring
with some prevention.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-refactorings">Preventing refactorings</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, you never have debates about refactoring because the team
orchestrate development with a perfect context and good understanding of the
situational challenges of the day. As a leader you need to be candidly honest
about upcoming tasks and deadlines.  Having an idea for a feature it’s not the
same as having a customer request and it’s not the same as having twenty
customer requests. Needing something for next week is not the same as needing
it for next month nor is the same as potentially needing it.</p>
<p>Summarily, engineers need to gauge the amount of uncertainty you have with a
feature. Of critical importance are the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the feature will be in active use or in potential use
</li>
<li>whether a requirement is definite or a sketch of an idea
</li>
<li>what is the freedom for digressing
</li>
<li>what are the business gains and risks
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having this information at hand helps engineers understand how to shape the
delivery of the code and associated “non-functional requirements”. For
instance, if a feature requires some good amount of data-crunching, a
preliminary data-exploration phase is welcome to help understand where edge
cases lurk.  If the task requires a system and not just some code, extra
monitoring, sometimes ad-hoc, will have to be built. If engineers understand
the business opportunities and risks associated with a feature, they’ll be in
better place to gauge how-much these “extras” are required.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-back-on-refactorings">Pushing back on refactorings</h2>
<p>Having in mind that refactorings are mostly-positive for the health of a
software. Senior engineers on a <a href="/hashtags/project.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="project">#project</span></a> may resent push backs and even identify
such push-backs as a threat to the qualify of the system. Therefore, a goal to
keep in mind is not to say “no” to a refactor. Rather, a productive
conversation seeks a good <a href="/hashtags/tradeoff.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="tradeoff">#tradeoff</span></a> for every party.</p>
<p>There are a few avaialble directions to tackle a “refactor-or-not” discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bluff</em> it out. Bluffing is a good way to lose trust from your colleagues.
You’ll come across someone who is dishonest if you bluff without success to
celebrate aside.  Some bluffing techniques are along delaying to improve the
understanding of the system you want to refactor, or some planned work that
will make the to-be-refactored system obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clarify</em> whether the refactoring is a pure-technical change or whether
the refactoring enables new features. Sometimes refactoring is an enabler for
pushing more feature (e.g., when you have data to filter/sort by a set of fixed
criteria and suddenly it’s better to change some querying-scheme such as
supporting “arbitrary” and likely-requested future criterias). This is the best
situation as you’ll learn better what are/are-not low-hanging fruit features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Characterize</em> qualitatively and if possible quantitatively the friction
induced by the absence of refactoring. You should be able to tell if the
refactoring specifically adress the pain point. You should understand whether
the gain is on the long-term or on the short-term.  Maybe a piece of code is
garbage, but is not touched very often leading to “one horrible day every
quarter”, which may be acceptable pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chunk</em>. Like most software endeavours, it’s better to split refactoring
in consecutive well-defined chunks. Often, one can split and time-box the
refactoring effort: for instance, do some code re-organization in a first part
then apply fundamental changes in a second part. If you frame a long-refactor
as a low-risk migration tasks spread over weeks you also train your team for
more dangerous and longer-to-rollout migrations. The risk here is that being
low-ROI the task never finishes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you do not have a large number of options to push back on
refactorings. Bringing more people on the team can help with a punctual
increase in work. Oftentimes you’ll have a better luck ensuring the overall
team momentum is maintained.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Cautionary tale: challenging whether a refactoring is necessary or not is a
sure-fire way to sow dissent and lose momentum. If you’ve read my long article
on <a href="/tactical-projects.html">successful tactical projects</a>, you’ll know how
much I care about momentum.</p>
<p>In general you should pay attention to functional cave-in and anticipate when
your project will go sideways.  Sometimes a business-requirement may ask for
technical changes throughout the project (for instance, data-modeling changes
incur verification on already-shipped code).</p>
<p>Allocate a fair amount of work onto technical tasks. Consider that
purely-technical work is part of the cost of doing business.  If engineers keep
bringing-up refactorings over refactoring there are things you can do to
push-back without too much trouble. Ask clarification around the functional
benefits of the change, characterize with the team what pain-points the
refactoring addresses, consider chunking the refactoring in a few steps to
allievate only the most pressing pain-point.</p>
<p>If nothing works, consider the help from senior engineers (architects,
lead-developers) because your team may lack from technical direction.  Of
course, if egos prevent your team members from seeking external consulting, you
will have a hard time convincing them to change their way of doing thing.</p>
