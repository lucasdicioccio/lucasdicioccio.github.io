<p>This article is the second in a series of articles on refactoring.</p>
</div>
<p>From a non-developer viewpoint, it may be hard to connect with developers who
are <strong>always refactoring</strong>. I wrote this article to fill some gap I observed a
number of times with non-technical stakeholders worried that tech teams where
“always refactorin’”. Cannot developers refactor once and move to something more
useful?</p>
<h1 id="introducing-refactoring">Introducing refactoring</h1>
<p>Let’s recollect what we have: we agglomerate code and see what sticks.  When
new features arrive, we either pause what we are doing and agglomerate more
stuff. When new horizontal requirements pop-up and sets back all your shipped
features, your project suffers.</p>
<h2 id="a-definition-of-refactoring">A definition of refactoring</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a technical task which consists in. While changing almost no behaviour.</p>
<p>Goal of the refactoring is pairwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>sediment and cement some idioms
</li>
<li>maintain an acceptable level of surprise/horror for people who need to touch the code or operate the system
</li>
</ul>
<p>Purely-technical tasks like changing the logging format are not really
recognized as refactoring but they share most of the characteristics: from a
business-user standpoint you see no behaviour, however from an operator-user
standpoint the behaviour changes.</p>
<p>This absence of external changes is desirable and developers will bring up
refactoring to help you understand how to classify this task: it takes work but
you need not know how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>=&gt; <span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span> Could lead to some breach of trust.
The catch: developer happiness and morale is part of their productivity.</p>
<h1 id="i-believe-my-team-is-always-refactoring-what-should-i-do">I believe my team is always refactoring what should I do?</h1>
<h2 id="first-is-it-really-true">First, is it really true?</h2>
<p>You need to settle on some acceptable amount of technical work, which includes refactors.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-back-in-a-healthy-way">Pushing back in a healthy way</h2>
<p>What is key to keep in mind: developers bring up refactoring tasks for a reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>upfront as preventative: when discussing new tasks, be honest about the amount of uncertainty you have with a feature, especially on things that are pretty structural like “can there be zero, one, many” items connected to a user, to a group etc.
</li>
<li>reframe/clarify whether it’s a refactoring or some other technical tasks, mostly you’ll be able to re-classify and you’ll realize that there is more complexity or richness to the work they do
</li>
<li>organizational:  quantify the friction accumulated, did the lack of refactor led to extra friction? can you weigh the refactoring work? can you budget an amount of refactoring time?
</li>
<li>bluff: it’s a good way to lose trust so you have to be really sure some near wins will offset this; say that you need a bit more real-world feedback (it’s in general true, but it’s often a small-lie we tell themselves because of how hard it is to collect scientifically sound feedback)
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Cautionary tale:</p>
<ul>
<li>some strict business requirements may act as technical requirements, just that the business is more ok with post-poning than things like an emergency patch
</li>
<li>when the technical requirement is a program, you have the same questions to answer but at a much larger scale, you need to devise specific strategies to weigh ROI (recommended to have functional-architects)
</li>
</ul>
