<p>This article is the second in a series of articles on refactoring.</p>
</div>
<p>From a non-developer viewpoint, it may be hard to connect with developers who
are <strong>always refactoring</strong>. I wrote this article to fill some gap I observed a
number of times with non-technical stakeholders worried that tech teams where
“always refactorin’”. Cannot developers refactor once and move to something
more useful?  Depending on the type of relationships between developers and
other roles, the question whether to refactor or not can become a point of
acute tension.</p>
<h1 id="refactoring-to-support-project-scope-changes">Refactoring to support project scope changes</h1>
<p>Let’s recollect what we introduced in the <a href="/what-is-the-project-scope.html">previous article about project
scopes</a> and the <a href="/scope-explorer.html">complementary
toy-application</a>. As software projects grow, we
accumulate code to enable features.</p>
<p>When a new feature is required, we are faced with an easy decision: pause
in-progress work and prioritize the new feature or continue on what is in
progress. Conversely, when a new technical or process requirement pops-up, we
are faced with more difficult decisions: we need to revisit everything in scope
that has been shipped already. A decision to implement or postpone is required
for each individual feature in scope. Typically, one can live with some gaps
for some time (e.g., missing tests, hardcoded parameters, outdated libraries,
manual approval in an otherwise automated process) but at some point the
infamous <em>technical debt</em> weighs too much and the feature can be considered
unfinished. In short, as requirements pile-up there is some risk that your
<strong>coverage effective reduces even though the amount of delivered tasks increases</strong>, an effect that I refer to as a <em>coverage cave-in effect</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/project-scope-timeline.png" alt="scope can suffer from cave-in" /></p>
<p>Refactoring is an attempt at mitigating cave-ins for upcoming requirements.
Engineers with some mileage will recognize the risks of cave-ins and will often
express the need to “refactor”.</p>
<h2 id="a-definition-of-refactoring">A definition of refactoring</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a technical task which consists in changing some technicals of a
feature without changing the external behavior of the refactored. Project managers raise eyebrows when someone wants to work.</p>
<p>Goal of the refactoring is pairwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>uniformize and cement some idioms or parametrization of processes
</li>
<li>maintain an acceptable level of surprise/horror for people who need to touch the code or operate the system
</li>
<li>typically, prepare for scope changes
</li>
</ul>
<p>Purely-technical tasks like changing the logging format are not really
recognized as refactoring but they share most of the characteristics: from a
business-user standpoint you see no behaviour, however from an operator-user
standpoint the behaviour changes.</p>
<p>This absence of external changes is desirable and developers will bring up
refactoring to help you understand how to classify this task: it takes work but
you need not know how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>=&gt; <span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span> Could lead to some breach of trust.
The catch: developer happiness and morale is part of their productivity.</p>
<h1 id="i-believe-my-team-is-always-refactoring-what-should-i-do">I believe my team is always refactoring what should I do?</h1>
<h2 id="first-is-it-really-true">First, is it really true?</h2>
<p>You need to settle on some acceptable amount of technical work, which includes refactors.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-back-in-a-healthy-way">Pushing back in a healthy way</h2>
<p>What is key to keep in mind: developers bring up refactoring tasks for a reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>upfront as preventative: when discussing new tasks, be honest about the amount of uncertainty you have with a feature, especially on things that are pretty structural like “can there be zero, one, many” items connected to a user, to a group etc.
</li>
<li>reframe/clarify whether it’s a refactoring or some other technical tasks, mostly you’ll be able to re-classify and you’ll realize that there is more complexity or richness to the work they do
</li>
<li>organizational:  quantify the friction accumulated, did the lack of refactor led to extra friction? can you weigh the refactoring work? can you budget an amount of refactoring time?
</li>
<li>bluff: it’s a good way to lose trust so you have to be really sure some near wins will offset this; say that you need a bit more real-world feedback (it’s in general true, but it’s often a small-lie we tell themselves because of how hard it is to collect scientifically sound feedback)
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Cautionary tale:</p>
<ul>
<li>some strict business requirements may act as technical requirements, just that the business is more ok with post-poning than things like an emergency patch
</li>
<li>when the technical requirement is a program, you have the same questions to answer but at a much larger scale, you need to devise specific strategies to weigh ROI (recommended to have functional-architects)
</li>
</ul>
