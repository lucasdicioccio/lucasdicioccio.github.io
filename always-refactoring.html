<p>This article is the second in a series of articles on refactoring.</p>
</div>
<p>From a non-developer viewpoint, it may be hard to connect with developers who
are <strong>always refactoring</strong>. I wrote this article to fill a gap. A number of
discussions with non-technical stakeholders were about the perceived feeling
that tech teams were “always refactorin’”.
Cannot developers refactor once and move to something more useful?  Depending
on the type of relationships between developers and other roles, the question
whether to refactor or not can become a point of acute tension.</p>
<h1 id="refactoring-to-support-project-scope-changes">Refactoring to support project scope changes</h1>
<p>Let’s recollect what we introduced in the <a href="/what-is-the-project-scope.html">previous article about project
scopes</a> and the <a href="/scope-explorer.html">complementary
toy-application</a>. As software projects grow, we
accumulate code to enable features.</p>
<p>When a new feature is required, we are faced with an easy decision: pause
in-progress work and prioritize the new feature or continue on what is in
progress. Conversely, when a new technical or process requirement pops-up, we
are faced with more difficult decisions: we need to revisit everything in scope
that has been shipped already. A decision to implement or postpone is required
for each individual feature in scope. Typically, one can live with some gaps
for some time (e.g., missing tests, hardcoded parameters, outdated libraries,
manual approval in an otherwise automated process) but at some point the
infamous <em>technical debt</em> weighs too much and the feature can be considered
unfinished. In short, as requirements pile-up there is some risk that your
<strong>coverage effective reduces even though the amount of delivered tasks increases</strong>, an effect that I refer to as a <em>coverage cave-in effect</em> (note: it is more typical to call that a functional regression).</p>
<p><img src="/images/project-scope-timeline.png" alt="scope can suffer from cave-in" /></p>
<p>Refactoring is an attempt at mitigating cave-ins for upcoming requirements.
The mitigation can be either anticipated or reactionnary. If you anticipated,
you do not observe the “cave-in” gap but the refactoring incurs some delay.  If
the refactoring work is reactionnary you get to do the same amount of work
anyway, except that you do it while your effective coverage is reduced. Thus,
engineers tend to like refactors, indeed, engineers with some mileage will
recognize the risks of cave-ins and will often express the need to “refactor”.</p>
<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>
<p>Refactoring is a technical task and a technical challenge: change how a
component operates without affecting the external behavior.  People obsessed
with “customer value” raise eyebrows because a refactor brings “no value” to a
product. Pedantic engineers will note that <strong>business value is not only
customer value</strong>. Indeed, engineers do not refactor for the desire of
challenges: engineers refactor to reach a more favorable state than from where
they started.</p>
<p>Examples of goals for refactors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>uniformize some idioms in a code-base so that (e.g., when merging two implementations from two different maturity levels a your product)
</li>
<li>keep an acceptable pain-level for people who need to maintain or operate the system
</li>
<li>prepare for planned ulterior scope changes (e.g., in order to internationalize a service)
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first example, the value resides in paying-up some “tech debt”.  In the
second example, the value is pairwise: liberate resources for higher-value
tasks and improve the satisfaction of team members (employee churn is an active
threat to teams’ success).  Finally, the third example is merely time-shifting
future work into the present, without changing much the actual customer value.</p>
<p>Among engineers, some purely-technical tasks like “changing the logging format”
may not be recognized as “a honest to god refactor”. Somehow, as far as our
discussion is concerned, and as far as engineer-product communication goes, the
decisive characteristics we care about is the absence of customer-value.  The
“refactoring” label merely is a shorthand for how to classify this task: it
takes work but if you are not an engineer you need not know how the sausage is
made.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding the goal of a refactoring task may lead to some breach of
trust between product and engineering <span class="emoji" data-emoji="warning">⚠️</span>.  The main catch is:
developers’ happiness and morale are part of their productivity and you have an
incentive and some moral obligation to create virtuous cycles rather than
self-defeating feedback loops.</p>
<h1 id="i-believe-my-team-is-always-refactoring-what-should-i-do">I believe my team is always refactoring what should I do?</h1>
<p>Now that things have been setup, let start the real talk. You are in a
frustrating situation where the team delivery feels slow, and engineers seem to
do refactoring over refactoring.</p>
<h2 id="first-is-it-really-true">First, is it really true?</h2>
<p>In all companies, you need to settle on some acceptable amount of technical
work, which includes refactors.  In a sense, it is the “cost of doing
business”. A fork of accepted technical work varies from 20% to 50% of the work
being mostly technical.  The proportion you observe should probably fluctuate
within this range and could deviate more depending on the erratic aspects of
companies’ timelines.</p>
<p>However, a team deviating for too long may be a reason for concern: too little
technical work probably means you are post-poning tasks you should have done
already, too much time spent on technical work may mean your team lacks
hindsights from senior engineers/architects.</p>
<p><img src="/images/always-refactoring-tunnel-01.jpeg" alt="technical work acceptable band" /></p>
<p>As illustrated in the above picture, if you plot the fraction of work spent
along time, you should expect some team to stay in the 20-50% band. In this
example, the green-plain line is okay, the two dashed-lines probably deserve
some investigation. The 20%-50% bracket is more a rule of thumb speaking from
experience (personal, former colleagues) than anything.</p>
<p>One caveat here is that you need some fair assessment of how much engineer time
is taken by refactorings.  From experience, I’ve seen that it may be
challenging for tech leaders to provide such a fair assessment.  Without
turning this post into some advertisment, <a href="https://www.echoeshq.com/">my current
company</a> provides a service to solve this question
among many.</p>
<p>Now, assuming you have legitimate concerns regarding some refactoring work,
let’s discuss the timing of refactoring. Then we’ll discuss avenues to
challenge and push back a team member who wants to refactor something when you
think there are better things to do.</p>
<h2 id="the-timing-of-the-refactoring-is-key">The timing of the refactoring is key</h2>
<p>Project planning, sprint sessions, are fun corporate ceremonies. A bit like
bargaining for a tea pot in a bazaar: no-one is encitivized to tell the truth.
As a result, discussing whether or not to refactor something is a
toxic-behavior magnet.</p>
<p>What is key to keep in mind: developers bring up refactoring tasks for a reason, and in general to avoid some functional cave-in.</p>
<p>Since refactorings are mostly to prevent some form of looming or occurred cave-in you can have these as:</p>
<ul>
<li>as preliminary work: as a stepping stone to make simplify things to build
</li>
<li>as wrap-up work: to consider a feature done (typically if you deploy something quick to improve the delivery-time of the feature, you will have learnt something about your system and your code-base you wish you had before)
</li>
<li>as intermediary work: a hiccup as occurred, due to the fractal nature of scope changes, while working on a feature a severe obstacle has popped-up
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, worst case, for one single feature, team members may argue three times in
favour of refactoring.  When multiple features are discussed as it is the case
in planning ceremonies, it may indeed feel like engineers really love
refactoring.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-back-while-maintaing-team-dynamics">Pushing back while maintaing team dynamics</h2>
<p>What are your strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>upfront as preventative: when discussing new tasks, be honest about the amount of uncertainty you have with a feature, especially on things that are pretty structural like “can there be zero, one, many” items connected to a user, to a group etc.
</li>
<li>reframe/clarify whether it’s a refactoring or some other technical tasks, mostly you’ll be able to re-classify and you’ll realize that there is more complexity or richness to the work they do
</li>
<li>organizational: quantify the friction accumulated, did the lack of refactor led to extra friction? can you weigh the refactoring work? can you budget an amount of refactoring time?
</li>
<li>bluff: it’s a good way to lose trust so you have to be really sure some near wins will offset this; say that you need a bit more real-world feedback (it’s in general true, but it’s often a small-lie we tell themselves because of how hard it is to collect scientifically sound feedback)
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Cautionary tale:</p>
<ul>
<li>some strict business requirements may act as technical requirements, just that the business is more ok with post-poning than things like an emergency patch
</li>
<li>when the technical requirement is a program, you have the same questions to answer but at a much larger scale, you need to devise specific strategies to weigh ROI (recommended to have functional-architects)
</li>
</ul>
