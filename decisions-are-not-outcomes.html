fall asleep, we are bound to make <a href="/hashtags/decisions.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="decisions">#decisions</span></a> to progress during the day. Most
decisions we make are inconsequential: which shirt to pick, what flavour of ice
cream to eat, and so on and so forth.  As a result, we may easily fool
ourselves that we are good at making decisions.  In practice, gauging whether a
decision is good or not is more difficult than it appears.  In particular, we
tend to conflate good decisions with good <a href="/hashtags/outcomes.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="outcomes">#outcomes</span></a>.</p>
<h1 id="decisions-and-situations">Decisions and situations</h1>
<p>If we want to improve our decision making, we need to train ourselves to assess
the quality of decisions independently from the outcomes of the decisions.</p>
<p>When we think what making good decisions entails, we often think about
decisions that will <em>improve</em> things. And a common mistake people do when
gauging decisions is to gauge the outcome. Indeed, we also make decisions that
leave us <em>indifferent</em>. And, alas, sometimes we need to make the <em>least worst</em>
decision.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate these three situations with a series of trivial examples. For
each example, you have two options: <code>A</code> or <code>B</code> and only one of the option can
be chosen.</p>
<div class="col3">
<pre><code>Situation-1

option-A:
- gain $50

option-B:
- gain $100
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Situation-2

option-A:
- gain $100,000,050

option-B:
- gain $100,000,100
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Situation-3

option-A:
- lose $100

option-B:
- lose $50
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In each of the three situations above, <code>option-B</code> is always more favorable than
<code>option-A</code>.  As a result, someone making good decisions would always pick
<code>option-B</code> over <code>option-A</code>.  Furthermore, <code>option-B</code> is always <code>$50</code> better
than <code>option-A</code>, somehow, to most people in Situation-2, either options will
feel indifferent.</p>
<p>An important observation in the above example is that any outcome of
Situation-2 is preferred over any outcome of Situation-1, which in turn is
preferred over any outcome of Situation-3. As a result, a person in Situation-3
taking <code>option-B</code> makes better decisions than a person in Situation-2 taking
<code>option-A</code>! meanwhile, the person in Situation-2 taking <code>option-A</code> is in a
significantly better place than the person in Situation-3 taking <code>option-B</code>.</p>
<p>The three situations above teach us the following: <em>how-good a decision is
independent from how-good an outcome is</em>. Further, to gauge whether a decision
is good or not, one must characterize the set of <em>available options</em> and then
compare options with each other. In short: given a same situation, would you
pick the same choice or not? Comparing options differs from comparing
<em>unreachable situations</em> with each other.</p>
<h1 id="distinguishing-between-decisions-and-situation-changes">Distinguishing between decisions and situation-changes</h1>
<p>The key to distinguish between attainable options and unreachable situations is
to understand whether an outcome is too-good-to-be-true <span class="emoji" data-emoji="tm">™️</span>.  Rational actors
would switch to a better situation if they could because <strong>chosing poorly in a
good situation results in better outcomes than chosing perfectly in a poor
situation</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, a first characteristics is that situations define a range of outcomes
whereas decisions merely move the needle withing a range of outcomes.  Thus,
two situation-changing “decisions” are easy to distinguish because there is
some boundary (or minimal overlap) between the ranges of achievable outcomes
after taking a decision.</p>
<p>For people with a more “visual mind”, we could depict these differences as
follows. Three situations (the range <code>[----]</code>) with a needle (the <code>-o-</code>).
Options would move the needle around whereas situation changes would flip your
situation to another row.</p>
<pre><code>                           range of possible outcomes
                 |--------------------------------------------------|
situation Alpha:    [-------------o--------]
situation Beta:                          [--------o-]
situation Gamma:                                 [o--------------]
</code></pre>
<p>The ranges in the example above characterize different <a href="/hashtags/situations.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="situations">#situations</span></a>: the
available choices for routine decisions are close to each other and result in
marginal changes of outcome.  Thus, hypotetically, after taking a first option
and re-assessing the situation: would your routine decisions (for which you are
mostly indifferent) fall on a similar continuum as if you had taken another
option first? If you answer yes, the option you are assessing is a
situation-changing option.</p>
<p><span class="emoji" data-emoji="exclamation">❗</span> Note, if you are a manager of technical people, suggesting that
switching situations is a mere decition will cross your interlocutor because
hypothesizing unrealistic options implies an obvious situation-changing choice
is not being made (i.e., it implies that your interlocutor is stupid).
Questions like “<strong>why don’t you just</strong> replace system-XYZ” will be received as
a sort of “stop-being-poor” insult or as intellectual-laziness. Not be the
brainstorm-session ice-breaker you hoped for.</p>
<p>Alas, lines are often blurry. In business settings especially, situations
that are unreachable to one may be reachable at an upper management echelon.
In particular, the role of strategy is to put you in good situations, whereas
the role of tactics is to make good decisions within your current situation.</p>
<p>Some business-settings examples of decisions among available options could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>hire a new employee or keep on course
</li>
<li>implement a piece of logic inside the DB or in the controller or in the model or in the view
</li>
<li>build anew or maintain a system
</li>
<li>should I investigate an issue by looking at changes or looking at logs or doing some reproduction checks
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some situation-changing decisions between unreachable (to most except C-suite
people) situations could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>stop paying for mission-critical systems to build in house
</li>
<li>replace the whole team or keep on course
</li>
<li>stop or not a money-making business-line with low profit-margins
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, people mixing available options and unreachable situations
happens on a regular basis. Probably not in extreme cases like my example
above, where people recognize that transitory situations will exist.  Making
realistic plans require hard work to draw a picture of how a company could move
from one situation to another one.</p>
<h1 id="making-better-decisions">Making better decisions</h1>
<p>Now we understand that a situation constrains the set of choices one can make.
Within this set of choice, then we still want to make good decisions.</p>
<p>To make good decisions you need to start with enumerating available options,
and enumerating and evaluating options is almost all there is to
good-decisions making.  Alas the enumeration itself can take too long or the
evaluation may fall short due to lack of information.</p>
<p>If we draw these two dimensions on a board, we can split decision-making in
four broad quadrants.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weighing-decisions-quadrants.png" alt="decision quadrants along evaluation difficulty and enumeration difficulty axes" /></p>
<p>Bottom-left are “easy decisions”: in these cases, intuitive choices are good
enough.  You can easily convince yourself which option is better and people
coming after you gauging and revisiting your choices with hindsight will easily
realize you were right.</p>
<p>Top-left are high-cost decisions that are amenable to scrutinization.  Many
(software) engineering situations fall in this quadrant: choices are few but
evaluation is difficult.  In this quadrant, I recommend to use evaluation
matrices and other tools like design docs (you’ll find a template on the
<a href="/talks.html">talks-and-docs page</a>) to formalize <strong>and record</strong> how decisions
were made.</p>
<p>Bottom-right are low-cost but numerous decisions. These choice happen when a
seemingly-single choice actually consists of a combination of choices and where
evaluation can be automated without too much guesswork.
<a href="/topics/optimization.html">optimizations frameworks</a> allows to enumerate and
compare choices efficiently. For these techniques to work on needs to restrict
the decisions to some formal and limited model of our reality.</p>
<p>Finally, in the difficult top-right quadrant, you may not be able to make a
good decisions. The only reassuring thing is that if you cannot devise a good
choice, your competitors likely are in a similar situation.  In such a
situation what is key is to understand the range of outcomes in
best/worst/average situations, and assessing whether investing efforts in
better decisions is offset by the outcome. Thus, you need some preliminary
investigation to justify whether rolling a dice is an okay-move or not.  If
high-stakes are at play (that is if the range of outcomes are such that making
a good decision is actually critical), I’d say that the best thing to do is to
seek help from people with modeling, simulation, and/or scientific-experiments
experience.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Decisions are choices in a set of options. Circumstances from your situation
determine the set of options available to you. Empathize with people (including
your past self) to disambiguate situations having poor outcomes from poor
decisions. What is key is: given the same input and the same situation, would I
still chose the same option?</p>
<p>In business settings, be careful to distinguish when decisions are tactical
(i.e., trying to improve the outcome by making some choices) from when
decisions are strategical (i.e., trying to improve the outcome by changing the
range of choices). When the strategy attempts such a transformation, often what
is amiss is a picture to move smoothly between two disconnected situations.</p>
<p>When deciding within options, your decision-making quality is a direct output
of how thorough is your assessment of the set of available options (the
enumeration) and your assessment of how good are options (the evaluation).
Once you have these, making a good decision is a matter of ranking among
choices.  Keep in mind that analyzing choices has a cost, and the effort made
to enumerate and rank choices should be smaller than the difference in outcomes
between good and bad decisions. To help during this process, you should rely on
decision frameworks like design-docs and mathematical modeling. Experts can
help you with these.</p>
<p>I hope that, in retrospect, you’ll think that reading this article was a good
decision <span class="emoji" data-emoji="grimacing">😬</span>. Have a good day!</p>
