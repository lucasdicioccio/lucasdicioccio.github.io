competition, <a href="https://www.salondaguerre.paris/en/">Salon Daguerre</a>. This year
was the second time in a row I contribute to the organization of the Salon.  My
contribution is not that much: I contribute as tech support.  I attend the
judgment but I do not participate scoring images. In short I am around to fix
the computer if something breaks. Since the technicals aspects always are
flawless (haha), I get to spend time and observe how the photo contest is
judged.</p>
<p>This article summarizes what I think could be of interest to contestants.
First, this article discusses technical aspects of how photos are shown.
Second, the articles discusses the judgment process, and finally I’ll give my
personal opinion about the process and some strategies when preparing your
entry. Disclaimer: everything in this article is specific to one competition and
other competitions will have different rules.</p>
<h1 id="technical-aspects">Technical aspects</h1>
<p>The main technical aspect influencing how judges will perceive photos is the
way photos are shown. In our case, photos are shown on a screen. Judges sit in
front of the screen in a same room.</p>
<p>Have you been to a TV shop? all those different TVs showing the same movie but
you do not get the same feeling from one TV to another one. The same is true
when looking at photos on a screen.  Resolution, crispness, brightness,
coloration etc.  all vary. Our screen is calibrated.  Although our screen is
calibrated and we can somewhat reproduce the display experience, your screen
may not. Also, keep in mind that your own screen and other factors are hard to
control (e.g., the ambient light in the room).</p>
<p>The display resolution is set to the maximum-size of submitted photos, which
happens to be 1920x1080 pixels so that a maximal photo takes the whole screen.
Modern computers, TVs, laptop screens typically have higher resolution than HD.
Our TV is 4K for instance (recall.  HD is 1920x1080, 4K is 3840x2160) for
something like one meter diagonal.  Further, many people now consume photos on
handheld devices, with screens much smaller than a TV like ours.  Hence, it is
better to assume that the screen and even individual pixels will be “larger”
than you are used to for watching photos.  If you prepare your photos on a
small device (e.g., on a laptop or smaller), my recommendation is to watch how
your pictures render on a large screen.</p>
<p>While you look at pictures on a TV-sized screen, keep in mind that screens will
want to make their own brightness, crispness, what-have-you adjustments. Thus,
go play in the settings and experience how your photo “degrades” along a range
of settings. If you do this exercise you’ll realize that a good way to destroy
your photo is to increase the sharpness cursor. Indeed, judges sit in front of
the TV at some distance so that they can comfortably see the whole screen at a
glance yet still see a fair amount of details.</p>
<p>If your photo does not match the maximal resolution of the contest, the photo
is not arbitrarily stretched (for obvious reasons).  Instead, the photo is
centered and laid over a black background.  Conversely, if your photo matches
the maximal resolution, the TV-frame will be the immediate background.  Like
most TVs, ours has a dark frame. As a result, images with dark around corners
will appear to blend in the background so that the exact frame size may not be
clear to the viewer.  If your composition uses proportions and is dark around
borders, your image may lose impact. Alternatively, you might want to
deliberately take the absence of clear border as an artistic choice. However
keep in mind that this effect will not show in a gallery/catalogue (our
catalogue historically has a gray background).  To completely remove lisibility
issues my recommendations are to do one of (or both): Expand the canvas of your
photo to fill the maximal size with the color of your choice (note: pay
attention to monochrome).  Add a few-pixels of light border as a clear
delimitation. With these, the border of your picture will become clear.</p>
<p>Only photos are shown. In particular, we do not show author names nor image
titles.  In particular, I want to stress that the title will not save an
hard-to-understand photography by adding extra context or giving away some
subtle hidden pun. You still want to spend some time on your titles as titles
are shown in the catalogue if your entry is accepted.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the effort you owe yourself is to try your pictures on a TV screen
with black background. Let’s now discuss the judgment process.</p>
<h1 id="on-the-judgment-itself">On the judgment itself</h1>
<p>The judgment takes place in a couple of days. During these days, three judges
have to gauge the merit of thousands of photos. That is, overall the average
time <a href="/hashtags/budget.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="budget">#budget</span></a> for a single photo is only a few seconds. However, judges are
explicitly told they can pause and discuss if they want. Such discussions occur
a handful of times over a judgment. Most of the photos, however, are voted for
while judges operate at some “cruise speed”.</p>
<p>Sections are judged one by one (e.g., all “open-theme color”, then all “trees”
photos). Photos of a same section are shown in a random order. Each photo is
judged before the next photo is shown. Thus judges vote for a photo as a
standalone artifact rather than by judging a photo as part of a whole. The
judgment attributes a <em>score</em> rather than a binary <em>accept/reject</em> choice. The
score is the sum of all grades given by individual judges. At the end of the
section, photos are ranked by score and tie breaking may occur where it matters
(i.e., at the top of the charts and at the accept/reject score boundary). The
vast majority of photos need no tie-break and thus will be scored once with
three grades.</p>
<p>Sections have rules. Read the rules.  The two broad rules are about meeting the
theme (e.g., “trees”, “open”) and constraints (e.g., “monochrome vs. color”).
Mistakes occur, and you just lose a chance. Neither organizers, nor judges, nor
you want to feel bad to disqualify a good photo because you misread whether a
section is monochrome or not.  Judging whether an image corresponds to a theme
on subjects (e.g., “trees”) or technical (e.g., “negative space”) is not always
a clear cut. Judges have to decide reasonably. However, if it is unclear
whether a photo is in the theme they may decide to penalize your photo because
the photo does not adhere well to the theme. What happens in general is some
judge asks others about how they feel about a photo and some consensus emerges.
However since this discussion takes time, judges end up expediting border-line
and average photos. For a border-line photo to be accepted, it must be <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>Avoid submitting series. The shuffling of photos destroys the consistency of
photo series. Not only a photo may be accepted and another one may be rejected.
But also the effect of seeing two related images with a dozen of unrelated
image in between is not nice. If the series is “intellectual” (e.g., a same
allegory with different subjects) the link will be too tenuous and you will
have spent this effort for no reward.  If the series is “graphical”, you leave
the impression that you do not know what is your best entry and let the judges
pick (boredom born from repetition may reduce your chances).  My recommendation
is: no series if the contest randomizes photo order. For contests which judge a
body of work, of course do make series.  An option could be to make a diptych
or triptych photomontage, but keep in mind that your are pixel-constrained.</p>
<p>In summary in Salon Daguerre, you are submitting a collection of standalone
photos rather than a body of work.  Keep in mind that photos must fit the
theme. The next section is more personal and contains suggestions of how to
approach contests with similar rules than in our photo-club.</p>
<h1 id="personal-opinion-and-strategies">Personal opinion and strategies</h1>
<p>As a spectator, you can see what photos get accepted on the catalogue, however
you cannot see photos which were rejected. My vantage point allows me to form
an opinion on what gets accepted versus what not.</p>
<p>First, I think that the judgment process is rather fair. Top-ranked photos
emerge as “good photos”. Although judging thousands of photos in a few days
seems like a difficult task, judges do a good job while keeping a rather fast
rythm. I think there is a minimal amount of “luck” in the process. I’d say the
first one or two dozens of photos in a series get votes that are a bit more
contrasted (i.e., being pushed up or pushed down, but rarely changing the
accept/reject decision). Further, since photos are shown in a random order,
no-one can take advantage of this behavior.</p>
<p>Second, I would say that you can aim for two very different goals when
participating to a photo contest like Salon Daguerre. A first goal would be to
get top-ranked photos, another goal would be to get many accepted photo.  For
the first goal, top-ranked photos, you’ll need to focus on producing a few
really good photos. For the second goal, you’ll <a href="/hashtags/budget.html"><span class="hashtag" data-hashtag="budget">#budget</span></a> your time on producing
multiple acceptably good photos.</p>
<p>My personal characterization of <em>good photos</em> – which can get a high score – is as follows. From most important to less important:</p>
<ul>
<li>subject and story of the photos are clear
</li>
<li>some novelty / originality / leaves some impression
</li>
<li>technically good
</li>
<li>fair amount of time has been spent on post-processing
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas my personal characterization of photos that stand a good chance are to get <em>accepted</em> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>subject and story of the photos are clear
</li>
<li>technically good
</li>
<li>not “overdone” (see below)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two characteristics are shared among accepted photos: the subject and the story
of the photos are clear and they are technically good.  An explanation is that
the judgment-speed plays a major role and ten seconds staring at a photo does
not allow an in-depth explanation. As a result, a photo where the subject is
not clear will get disadvantaged. I would even say that a photo with
alternative framing choices that could hypothetically work are at a
disadvantage. If you put yourself in the shoes of the judge, you need to look
at a photo and say “I cannot change anything”. Conversely, a photo that has
technical flaws (e.g., poor framing, camera shake) or where a judge would say
“I would have framed it this way instead” will get voted down.</p>
<p>Some photo belong to “canonical categories” (e.g., standard portraits, sports,
animals, landscapes) and are generally welcome in multiple sections. Similarly,
some photos have been done and done-again (e.g., partial desaturation,
tone-mapped HDR, un-original scenic spots). For these photos, you less likely
to rank high but you can still get a photo accepted if you bring an interesting
twist. For these photos, keep in mind that the photo-shot has to be technically
flawless but that only will not suffice.</p>
<p>In summary. Keep in mind that photos get judged fast. They need to leave a
lasting impression as photos you remember and which are technically flawless.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">conclusion</h1>
<p>As a participant of photo contests, your reward is visibility and peer
recognition.  Participating as co-organizer, the reward I get is to be able to
attend to photo judgments and build an intuition of what makes a “winning
photo”. My recommendation is that if you participate to a photo contest do it
with the intent to win from the start of the process. If you look at your
catalogue of good photos and cherry-pick some you will not be putting the right
amount of effort in selecting or processing the photo.  Photos need to be
technically good and give a lasting impression in a few seconds. At a same
time, photos need no obvious flaws. In short, winning photos are simple to
undersand, easy to remember, impossible to discard.</p>
