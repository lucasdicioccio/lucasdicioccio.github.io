I used to prefer giving meetup <a href="/talks.html">talks</a>,
then the pandemic came and I wanted to start blogging a bit. I wrote nothing,
mostly due to the lack of blogging platform I liked.  This year, one resolution
I took is to remediate this situation and start writing some technical content.
After past and more recent attempts at using a SAAS blogging platform, hosting
a Wordpress, or generating a Jekyll site, I always got frustrated. Thus I
decided once that my website would be hand-written HTML files. I always felt
some friction: writing content requires some uninterrupted stream of thought,
whereas formatting HTML require focus and gets in the way. Writing the text in
one document and then formatting the HTML is not good because any change
requires modifications in multiple places.</p>
<p>Without much surprise, I ended up writing my own engine. This article explains
what I really want of a blog-engine and how I’ve implemented it.</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Let’s make a checklist</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> static-site first, APIs second
</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> live preview with auto reload
</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> markdown for the meaty content, functional layouts
</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> customizable CSS, JS per article
</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> metadata for layout and stats
</li>
</ul>
<h3>static-site first, serving second</h3>
<p>Hosting a static site is much simpler. GitHub does it for free.  At this point
I cannot justify maintaining API endpoints for posting comments, nor a database
to store them. I still would like to be able to fluidly move to something
beefier with a web server for instance, and without having to port all the
meaty content. That is, if I occasionally need an API call, I can still
imagine having a static-site first, with only a meager amount of web-serving.</p>
<p>A nice side-effect is that <code>git</code> is a natural database of content, and
git-based flows could serve in multi-authors situations.</p>
<h3>developer mode with live-preview</h3>
<p>I like quick feedback loops. The fastest feedback loop likely is a WYSIWYG
editor, however my experience with WYSIWYG is not great. To make WYSIWYG works,
these tools must have their own limitations, for instance it is hard to be
consistent across pages due to the free-hand nature of the tool. WYSIWYG tools
work with their internal and opaque data structures, which hinder composition
with other tools.</p>
<p>From experience with LaTeX and markdown in GitHub/GitLab documents, I think a
fast-preview is good enough. A Live-preview like in HTML-IDE is almost as good
as the immediacy of WYSIWYG. Given that I am writing HTML content, I could use
a JS script to automatically reload after changes like some JS applications
frameworks (e.g., NextJS) offer.</p>
<h3>markdown for the <em>meaty</em> content, functional layouts</h3>
<p>To make a blog page you need two broad set of HTML information, the meaty
content and the layout parts. The meaty content is the large amount of words
and paragraphs and images that make the core of the site. This is what readers
are interested in. The layout is what readers (and robots) need to navigate and
discover the content. The layout adds some wrapping and normalization of
headers, footers etc.</p>
<p>To write meaty-content, you typically want a language with little line-noise
than then renders to HTML chunks. Platforms have a variety of syntax for
this. For instance, Wikipedia has its own format with specific features to
recognize links between articles etc.  Beside supporting a ‘flow of
consciousness’ approach, these formats are good because we can easily re-use
existing tooling such as the <code>aspell</code> spellchecker, <code>grep</code> to locate some
keywords  without too much false-positive.  For my own blog I settled on
<a href="https://commonmark.org/">Commonmark</a> which is roughly
<em>enhanced-markdown-with-a-proper-spec</em>. Commonmark has been invented by one
author of Pandoc, which gives a lot of credit to the initiative.</p>
<p>In tension with the “meaty content” is the “layout”. We need to wrap out meaty
content with repetitive information but also with a fair amount of
article-specific dynamic information (e.g., the publication date should always
be at the same position, a list of keywords should be present when keywords are
present). I need some automated templating to achieve a proper layout, some
templating languages exist like <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>,
<a href="https://haml.info/">Haml</a>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template">GoTemplate</a>, but
I always felt the overhead of learning these specific syntaxes and using these
outweighs their benefit. Let me elaborate a bit: these templating languages
are constrained to avoid doing things like starting a web-server while
rendering some HTML. They support constructs like iterations into structures
for repeated information (e.g., for each tag add a <code>&lt;li&gt;{{tag.name}}&lt;/li&gt;</code>
content). This is all good, however for any non-trivial layout, you end up
preparing a very specific data structure with all the right computations (e.g.,
sorting, numbering things). In the end, you need to morally prepare your
template twice: first in the rendering to HTML in the template language itself,
a second time in the data structure you pass to the template engine. Maintenance
is complicated, and you lose a lot of type checking benefits at the boundary of
between your own language and you template language. In short, you gained
little at extra cost.</p>
<p>In my opinion, tempting and layout are solved by the constraints of
pure-functions from some dataset to an HTML structure <code>DataSet -&gt; HTML</code>. Hence,
functional programming is the right tool for the job. I happen to know Haskell
well, the author of Commonmark wrote a couple of libraries in Haskell
<span class="emoji" data-emoji="arrow_right">➡️</span> overall I have no reasons to shy away and pick something
different.</p>
<h3>customizable metadata, CSS, JS per article</h3>
<p>I have ideas for some articles that would benefit from having special CSS or
special JS scripts (e.g., to add some interactivity). Ideally, I want the
ability to insert assets on a per-page basis. Since there are different reasons
for inserting a specific asset (e.g., the layout is different for a generated
article listing than for a normal article), customization could be written at
the Haskell side or in the meaty content but in most cases we should configure
that from the meaty content. Ideally, I would type multiple sections in a
single file to avoid spreading what is a single article into many files with a
proper directory structure (I don’t enjoy structuring directories until I feel
enough pain to do so). An example of files with sections are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Multipart_messages">multipart-emails</a>.  And
your email client can totally make sense of images, HTML parts, text parts from
a condensed text file.  Let’s take inspiration on this.</p>
<h2>Synthesis of requirements</h2>
<p>The thing I want is some Haskell-variant that (a) interprets markdown-like
files for the <em>meaty content</em> then passes that into (b) some rendering
function. These files could (c) be augmented with extra data and extra CSS/JS.
The tool I want would have a generate-static-site and a serve-on-the-fly-files
to accommodate the ambivalent ‘static but also live but also with an API if I
want one day’ aspects.</p>
<p>I don’t really want to invest time in learning something that will be
irritating in one of these dimensions. Established tools may be too rigid to
accommodate some of my quirks. The closest tool I found likely is
<a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell static-site generation
library. It supports some form of metadata per-article for customizing the
article (e.g., picking a certain layout) but I really want to insert multiple
sections.</p>
<p>Thus, overall, I got a pretext to <strong>invent my own</strong> .</p>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Let’s first say that the implementation I present here does not represent the
whole iterations.  I first started with a simple file-to-file generator taking
exactly one <code>.md</code> file with multiple sections and  turning that into <code>.html + .css</code> . Proper layouts and live-reloads came later, the whole blog has been a
single Haskell file until long (i.e., when compilation time where too long
while changing only the layout).</p>
<p>This section does not speak about Haskell but rather focuses on the general
architecture.  Thus when I say “a function” you can imagine it’s “a monad” if
you feel compelled to entertain an annoying cliché about Haskellers detached from
reality.</p>
<h2>Main Architectural Blocks</h2>
<p>The following picture sketches roughly the blog engine pipeline.</p>
<p><img src="/gen/images/blog-phases.dot.png" alt="pipeline" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>compile</strong> <code>ghc</code> turns Haskell code into a <code>binary</code> that contains the blog layout and advanced rules
</li>
<li><strong>read</strong> collects all input files, possibly other sources
</li>
<li><strong>assemble</strong> builds an understanding of everything that needs to be generated, copied etc.
</li>
<li><strong>produce</strong> writes all the needed files to the right location
</li>
</ol>
<p>So overall it is pretty simple and nothing is ground-breaking.  Assuming the
compile step is already done you have a binary. The binary will have a fixed
layout that can generate a blog for new content. To illustrate, adding a <em>new
article</em> is done by adding a new <code>.md</code> file but <strong>requires no recompilation</strong>. But
<em>changing the HTML</em> structure to display the social links <strong>requires a
code-change and a recompilation</strong>.</p>
<p>To motivate the next sections it is worth detailing the assembly-part of the
blog engine. Let’s focus on <code>read -&gt; assemble -&gt; produce</code> steps.</p>
<h3>detailed assembly pipeline</h3>
<p>A more detailed conceptual pipeline of the three last steps is as follows.  In
the following graph arrows represent the data flow (i.e., starting from inputs
data representations progress towards the output files).</p>
<p><img src="/gen/images/blog-engine.dot.png" alt="pipeline" /></p>
<p>At the top you get input files such as CSS or Commonmark files. We could easily
add external inputs as well. All these sources get stuffed into an object named
<code>Site</code> which sort of contains the whole knowledge about inputs for a Site.</p>
<p>An <code>assemble</code> function then takes the <code>Site</code> and turns that into <code>Targets</code>
objects.  The Targets themselves are not yet concrete files. Rather, they are
annotated recipes about how to produce a single output. The recipe itself is
named a <code>Production Rule</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Production Rules</code> then can be executed on demand to either generate static
files or being generated on the fly by a web-server (if the web-server is
written in Haskell).  We are lucky enough to have very good web-servers and
web-API libraries in Haskell which allows to compose such an hybrid system –
this hybrid system is handy for the developer-mode.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the pipeline (highlighted in the picture) is that the <code>assemble</code> function actually is a bit more complicated than a mere mapping from JS, Markdown etc. There are two complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra-Targets can be computed from main targets, for instance each topic gets a listing page. These rules mainly are written in Haskell: the <code>index.md</code> also needs the list of all <code>Article</code> targets to generate extra content on top of some text written in Commonmark; for each <code>tag</code> we create an index Target page and they all use the same <code>tags.md</code> instructions
</li>
<li><code>Articles</code> are written in Commonmark however the blog engine expects a special format that contains <code>Sections</code>, these Sections contain the meaty content but also metadata information in JSON and commands that could lead to generating more files
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I need to use an ad-hoc mix of Haskell and Commonmark to generate
pages and their templates. This mix is means there sometimes is two ways to do
a thing (e.g., should I add some default CSS file in the layout or via includes
in the CSS-section of individual articles so that I can override it entirely?)
with no clear immediate tradeoff.</p>
<h2>Section-based file format</h2>
<p>Basically an input file is suffixed something</p>
<pre><code>=base:build-info.json
{&quot;layout&quot;:&quot;article&quot;
}

=base:preamble.json
{&quot;author&quot;: &quot;Lucas DiCioccio&quot;
,&quot;date&quot;: &quot;2022-02-01T12:00:00Z&quot;
,&quot;title&quot;: &quot;An article about Haskell&quot;
}

=base:topic.json
{&quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;haskell&quot;, &quot;some-tag&quot;]
,&quot;keywords&quot;:[&quot;some keyword&quot;]
}

=base:social.json
{&quot;twitter&quot;: &quot;me&quot;
,&quot;linkedin&quot;: &quot;myself&quot;
,&quot;github&quot;: &quot;again-me&quot;
}

=base:summary.cmark

Some summary.

=base:main-content.cmark

# this is an h1 title

## this is an h2 title

lorem ipsum ...

=base:main-css.css
@import &quot;/css/main.css&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Dev-mode and auto-reload</h2>
<p>The dev-server API itself is written with my
<a href="https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/prodapi">prodapi</a> API library, which curates
some good Haskell libraries for building APIs. There is enough to help running
background tasks in the process (e.g., to watch for file-changes), and also to
expose other endpoints (e.g., a listing of all targets or metrics).</p>
<p>I have a poor-man’s <code>autoreload.js</code> script (source here <a href="/js/autoreload.js">source of auto-reload
script</a>). That perform long-polling to a API route <code>/dev/watch</code>
that only the dev-webserver knows about (i.e., there won’t be a Target to
generate for this URL path). This API route serves as rendez-vous mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>the client waits for an answer to the API call
</li>
<li>the dev-server watches for changes in the source directory with <code>inotify</code> and flushes waiting clients
</li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation only works with a single watch at a time but it is
sufficient for a single user. The full-page reload is acceptable as most of the
articles I will ever write will mostly be stateless.</p>
<h1>Experience report</h1>
<p>It has been fun to write some get-shit-done Haskell code. I sincerely believe
this blog engine does not have to shy away in face of other tools. I will
surely try to extract the library code as a standalone engine at some point.</p>
<p>Let me explain a few things that I find rather pleasant.</p>
<h2>Sections and file generators</h2>
<p>I quickly built enough to generate HTML, copy images around. More interesting are the following generators.</p>
<ul>
<li>generator dotfile:  turn a .dot file into a .png with <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>
</li>
<li>section command-gen: generates a file from a UNIX command (e.g., to get a special file with the git-sha or build timestamp)
</li>
<li>section summary: short Commonmark content that appear in article listings (it also gets stripped to text to add a meta tag)
</li>
<li>section taken-off: stuff that is in the source but will be ignored, useful for draft sections
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Commonmark is great</h2>
<p>The Commonmark package <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions">supports extensions</a>.
For instance, I have enabled the emoji syntaxt that turns <code>:smiley:</code> into
<span class="emoji" data-emoji="smiley">😃</span>. I also enabled support for directly adding HTML tags (including JS)
or annotating sections of code with HTML attributes if the rendering is not
sufficient.</p>
<p>Another use case is when you want to drop down to HTML or if you need
small-scripting capabilities.</p>
<p>Inlining the following code …</p>
<pre><code>::: {.example}

  press to get an alert
  &lt;button class=&quot;example-button&quot; onClick=&quot;alert('hi from commonmark')&quot;&gt;press me&lt;/button&gt;

:::
</code></pre>
<p>… gives the following rendering (with some CSS style defined in the CSS-section).</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>press to get an alert</strong>
<button class="example-button" onClick="alert('hi from commonmark')">press me</button></p>
</div>
<p>A more-complicated insertion below shows you can embed JavaScript for visualizations (example with <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html">Vega-Lite</a>). Which loads a special file <a href="/json/filecounts.json">json-file-counts</a> that has been generated as a special Target part of the layout. However, a generator section could also create a similar target.</p>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.21.0"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.2.0"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.20.2"></script>
<div id="vis">
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var yourVlSpec = {
    $schema: 'https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json',
    description: 'A simple bar chart with embedded data.',
    data: {
      url: "http://localhost:7654/json/filecounts.json"
    },
    mark: 'bar',
    encoding: {
      x: {field: 'srctype', type: 'ordinal'},
      y: {field: 'count', type: 'quantitative'}
    }
  };
  vegaEmbed('#vis', yourVlSpec);
</script>
<h2>Future ideas</h2>
<p>Regarding <em>templating</em>. I still would like some interpreted templating (e.g.,
Mustache) for some very specific cases such as data tables, with data generated
from another section.  The reason is that to add a new article I should write
code only for the article rather than splitting haskell and Commonmark around
(exceptions are special pages like <code>tags.md</code> and <code>index.md</code>).</p>
<p>This will require some extra wiring in the Target-assembly part and some
difficult decision as to what is really-static and what is in-fact dynamic.  My
main inspiration are <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks.</p>
<p>Regarding new <em>sections</em> or <em>targets</em>. I would like to allow to have
scripting-language sections (for now I only have direct shell commands). For
instance to generate a picture using <code>R</code> or <code>Python</code>. It would be nice as well
to inline the dot-source of GraphViz pictures directly in the <code>.md</code> file.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>dependency-graphs</em>. I would like to have a section where required
URLs can be declared. Doing so will enable more interesting build sequences.</p>
