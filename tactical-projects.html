<a href="https://aide.vente-privee.com/category/703-re-cycle">innovative e-commerce business around second-hand garnment and sustainable
clothing (<span class="emoji" data-emoji="fr">🇫🇷</span>)</a>.  The
time-window was pretty short and there was only one extra developer on the
project but we made it and I could transfer the project to perpetuate and
stabilize the business while I moved to other opportunities.  At the same
company a few years before I was invited to fix a pressing issue that could
have led to severe liabilities. An important pipeline was stalling and risked
putting many business process to a halt. Institutional knowledge was partly
lost and mostly transmitted by oral lore. Recovering the pipeline backlog and
deprecating this pipeline took months and from six to a dozen of people
depending on how you count. The company is still around, so we can also call
that project a success.</p>
<p>In both cases these projects were recognized as <em>tactical</em> endeavours. That is,
one-time feats to achieve, with a fair amount of freedom to step out of typical
company guidelines and processes.  Even though the scale and timeframe
differed. What made both these critical topics click was not the technology,
but the team dynamics. We made some internal presentations for these, but I
also wanted to share a bit to the outside world how I approach these projects.
This article discusses my <em>recipe</em> to tactical projects.</p>
<h1 id="a-recipe-to-approach-tactical-projects">A recipe to approach tactical projects</h1>
<p>I wrote a couple of Twitter threads relating how I approach these tactical
projects. A first <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1329847102843838466">lengthy thread</a>
discusses briefly my <em>checklist</em> and then motivates some items. The checklist gives you <strong>a set of tools</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1340257658121691136">follow up thread</a> is much shorter and stresses the approach and the importance of giving boundaries more than instructions. This approach gives you <strong>a set of behaviours</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ll get through the checklist, discuss key behaviours to foster, and elaborate more.</p>
<h2 id="a-checklist-of-communication-tools">A checklist of communication tools</h2>
<p>Successful projects require communication. If we stretch a bit, all the tools
from the checklist I am about to give are a form of communication support.
Communicating efficiently is hard because abundant communication is noisy, you
cannot just fix communication issues with more communication but with <em>better</em>
communication. In tactical projects, I believe that better means <em>intentional</em>
communication. That is, do not multiply communication supports and focus on one
usage per support. Such intentionality leaves no room for ambiguity as where to
look for information and where to publish information.</p>
<p>Here is the checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="book">📖</span> one jargon-doc to map concepts
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="calendar">📆</span> one periodic-meetings doc
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="libra">♎</span> one open-point/arbitrage doc
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="raising_hand">🙋</span> one communication channel for people
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="robot">🤖</span> one dump channel for robots
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="point_left">👈</span> one main-doc which links to all the other docs
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the specific tool you use for these documents and chats, the offering is
pretty good today as long as they allow an online and direct-edition mode.
Examples of good tools for such docs are <strong>GoogleDocs</strong>, <strong>Notion</strong>,
<strong>Confluence</strong>.  Pick the ones you are familiar with and that you already use.</p>
<p>Let’s now dig a bit each of the checklist item.</p>
<h2 id="in-depth-review-of-the-checklist-items">In depth review of the checklist items</h2>
<p>This section just dives deeper in each topic. Each item deserves a lenghty
discussion but I will keep if concise for brevity. Do not hesitate to <a href="/about-me.html">contact
me</a> if you want me to expand on one aspect.</p>
<h3 id="the-jargon-document">the jargon document</h3>
<p>There is some selection bias in so-called tactical-projects, and often such
projects will have the characteristics of the difficult project to rescue:
business rules are blurry if not lost, documentation and specification may have
drifted enough that even subject-matter experts have forgotten there is a
documentation.</p>
<p>The problem you face with such a situation is the inability to get started, and
the risk of having to roll back a lot of work once it is delivered because code
is written with some miscommunicated assumption.</p>
<p>To solve communication issue, the basics is to have some mutual understanding
between stakeholders. Oftentimes terms may be overloaded and a same word will
have different meaning depending on the interlocutor. The worst I have seem was
a term that was defined in French, but when translated to English, was a
slightly different concept for the same stakeholder. A seasoned engineer was
agast when I told him so, because the code would not make a difference (and
business-wise, the two concepts would coincide often enough for the happy
cases, but could lead to corny edge cases otherwise).</p>
<p>Your role here is not to fix everybody’s language. That would be hopeless and
too disturbing anyway. However all hope is not lost: you can bring mutual
understanding by exposing the differences in concepts for the same word.  A
common mistake I have seen is to write a glossary. <strong>You do not need a
glossary, what you really need is a Rosetta stone</strong> .</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Rosetta_Stone.JPG" alt="rosetta stone" /></p>
<p>I provide example jargon-file in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJpqpAxFFoViP9XEDwKRzm1Od1g6w9DtwYTDzlMkwQs/edit?usp=sharing">jargon
spreadsheet</a>
.  Of importance is that you leave room for each stakeholder to disagree with
your use of a term. In this way, everyone feels respected because there is no
bias favoring the viewpoint of the file author. This is why the jargon file has
a matrix of terms and stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="the-periodic-meetings-doc">the periodic-meetings doc</h3>
<p>When in the heat of tactical projects, you need some amount of synchronization
with all stakeholders and teamates. Often, a few topics will be the focus of
attention for a couple of days or weeks.  You should forget synchronization
emails because emails sent to many people invite cross-talk in replies and
re-sharing truncated bits. If you use email to communicate, only use email for
outbound communications to less-involved stakeholders (e.g., C-level
executives).</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Grand_Turk%2834%29.jpg" alt="livre de bord" /></p>
<p>Instead, I posit that you want some for of journal where you synthetically
review these topics.  At the same time, when reviewing these topics, it is
marginally more expensive to review exhaustively what is on the plate of whom.
Indeed, most of your efforts should be focused on the key topics du jour and
only a few will work on other topics. Giving attention to these secondary
topics is also important for the morale of those and for the habit because the
focus will eventually shift. Additionally, keep some room to review HR topics,
especially days off so that no-one is surprised when someone leaves for two
weeks.</p>
<p>The following link is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_1an91IYoZwecigqwtsIPQ5ivxp4aS9sv_DaVRScvqU/edit?usp=sharing">template for periodic-meeting
notes</a>
I like to use. You do not have to follow this template but I’ll tell how to use
it.  For each team meeting, add a section by copying the <code>template</code> section
just below in the doucment and editing the date. You can prepare a section
ahead of time and should encourage to fill-it in as they progresss (in my
example “dany” has marked an update in advance).  During meetings, review
items, prioritizing new entries on key topics and action items from previous
meeting. Copy and indicate carried over entries from previous meetings until
resolution or decision to drop.  Ensure that there is some markup to quickly
identify people and action-items with their current state (e.g. <code>AI</code> for action
item, <code>@name</code> of <code>[name]</code> for people, bold fonts, strikethrough for done
tasks). It’s better to be clear than to be consistent. Updates should be
synthetic and provide links to other work document to follow the specific topic
in more detail (e.g., tasks in issue trackers).</p>
<p>The document will grow, I’ve seen such a document with hundreds of pages on
Google Docs and they work pretty well. Only create a new periodic-meetings doc
if editing the current one becomes unbearable (e.g., the software becomes too
slow). Sticking to a single document has a lots of benefit: First, you have a
single entry point to know what are the topics du jour and the state of people
assigned to work on these topics. Second, you get a quick access to who-works
on what and a sense of who-needs support (e.g., if a name does not show up,
maybe the person is suffering a loss of motivation). Finally, the document is
easy to search with <code>ctrl-F</code>: everyone knows how to do that and the UX
typically is better than cross-documents searches.</p>
<h3 id="open-pointarbitrage">open-point/arbitrage</h3>
<p>Tactical projects will mix people with different seniority. Further, you will
need to pro-actively cut corners. Sometimes you will have to hand-over the
project at the end of the tactical mission. Thus, it is better to keep track of
all the key arbitrages in a single document. Arbitrage will often be required
for technical aspects (e.g., architecture, database structures, naming
conventions) but could also span business aspects (e.g., decision to drop or
limit data-recovery to a time-bound).</p>
<p>I provide a design-document template in my <a href="/talks.html">talks</a> section, which
I recommend for large projects. For tactical projects you will not have the
luxury of doing such good and time-consuming work. That said, you still want
the benefits from some formal process: you want a minimal context and a listing
of alternatives one can think about, then a status.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Estatueta_Justi%C3%A7a.JPG" alt="balance of justice" /></p>
<p>It is useful to have a table of content and a todo/done status in the titles to
quickly see what has been decided yet and what needs arbitration.</p>
<p>Once the document is in place, spam it around. Encourage people to submit new
open-points, link to them during the periodic-meeting.</p>
<p>As for the two previous checklist item, you can find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vuImyR-qNiZ4GEoyAhgUts1PkrQYYRnvLD5IvvSa-0/edit?usp=sharing">an example open-points document</a>.</p>
<h3 id="one-communication-channel-for-people">one communication channel for people</h3>
<p>Modern organization use some online group chats tools. If you don’t, start with
this.  Group chats are easy to adapt to different processes and work
organizations. I’ve seen as many group-chats organizations as I have seen
teams: some teams used a single channel, some other teams would create
transient channels for open points. Overall I’ve seen success and failures in
either setups. For a tactical project, I tend to prefer having a single
communication channel. Indeed, the size of teams in tactical projects allow a
single channel to be busy without becoming jammed (if you need to involve many
teams, maybe you’re not on a tactical project but would need a whole backbone
of engineering management).</p>
<p>The one communication channel serves for orchestration rather than as a support
for communications. That is, use the channel to schedule/reschedule the
periodic-meeting and ping people that the meeting starts.  Also use the channel
to first notify that something of note requires attention or requires
arbitration. Key points should be discussed and related in the periodic-meeting
notes or in the arbitration docs.</p>
<p>Avoid multiplying channels for open points because you will churn through them
and lose track of what is ongoing and what is done. Having many chats with
distinct and partially-overlapping sets of interlocutors is a recipe for
cross-talks. You end up bringing the wrong topic in the wrong chat by mistake,
when you need someone that was not invited first, they will lack the history
(let’s be honest, chats history are horrible to process for humans).</p>
<p>An exception to have a few more channels is if you have regulatory requirements
(e.g., some info must stay more confidential or require some clearance). But
for this use case, private chats probably are a better venue as they feel more
transient</p>
<h3 id="one-communication-channel-for-robots">one communication channel for robots</h3>
<p>Automation is a special case that warrants an online chat as well.  Automation
will spam you about CI runs, people who pushed code etc. Overall, automation is
screamy, pollutes, and does not respect your daily break.</p>
<p>Avoid overloading the communication channel for people with automated messages.
This distinction is less important if all the stakeholders are tech people who
understand that an “alert” may not be a reason for alert, nor that daily
failures are expected.</p>
<p>The same points against multiplying channels as for the communication for
people apply: you should favor a single channel until it becomes unbearable.
Co-locating alerts with deployments notifications may help spot regression as
well.</p>
<h3 id="one-main-doc-which-links-all-the-other-docs">one main-doc which links all the other docs</h3>
<ul>
<li>the checklist is rather narrow, you may need other docs (pre-existing specifications, slides)
</li>
<li>bookmarks UX are really bad, hard to share, people are not familiar with the tools (unlike your shared doc tool)
</li>
<li>each time a link or document pops, add an entry to the doc, the entry should have a catchy title (see jargon, the title will become the de-facto name for the doc among the team)
</li>
<li>bang that rule on people’s head, nudge them towards making this doc their only bookmark
</li>
<li>do not over organize until you have some acute need, again, ctrl+F will do wonders, especially if docs have catchy names
</li>
<li>content can be a simple table like the one below
</li>
</ul>
<div id="master-doc-example">

<h2 id="the-maestro-analogy">The maestro analogy</h2>
<ul>
<li>people will have various instrument: some play brass whereas some others play strings
</li>
<li>people will have various styles: some play jazz, some prefer classical, you may need them to play modern chamber music
</li>
<li>as a lead you have one key role: set the tempo
</li>
<li>you must ensure they tune-in, you do not know how they should play but you know how it should sound
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ceremonies">Ceremonies</h2>
<ul>
<li>no fixed ceremony will solve your problems
</li>
<li>the main benefit I find to ceremonies are their agenda-locking power: people have no excuse to miss them
</li>
<li>typically you will need some frequent meeting to go through the periodic-meeting notes
</li>
<li>daily may be too strict, weekly to slow
</li>
<li>you set the tempo, so you should adapt depending on the pace, the urgency, and the delivery you expect (it happened that we made one meeting every other week, whereas sometimes as deadlines or key delivery approach we meet twice a day or assemble in the same place and pair)
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directing-with-boundaries">Directing with boundaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>people sincerely hate micro-management, seriously
</li>
<li>you won’t have the luxury to review everything and will need to cut corners, eroding your faith in the “trust but verify” adage
</li>
<li>I prefer “set the boundary and trust”
</li>
<li>you must learn how to direct with boundaries
<ul>
<li>explain some key behavior or invariants that you can verify in your systems
</li>
<li>motivate, and rephrase them, formally and informally (e.g., the zorgulino criterion is that all time you make a change, you need to see only diffs in the positive direction in the all-accounts total; this value is non-decreasing of version numbers etc.)
</li>
<li>repeat them often, even when validating someone (e.g. “you are correct, looks like your implementation idea meets the zorgulino criterion, I trust you for the details”)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
