<a href="https://aide.vente-privee.com/category/703-re-cycle">innovative e-commerce business around second-hand garnment and sustainable
clothing (<span class="emoji" data-emoji="fr">🇫🇷</span>)</a>.  The
time-window was pretty short and there was only one extra developer on the
project but we made it and I could transfer the project to perpetuate and
stabilize the business while I moved to other opportunities.  At the same
company a few years before I was invited to fix a pressing issue that could
have led to severe liabilities. An important pipeline was stalling and risked
putting many business process to a halt. Institutional knowledge was partly
lost and mostly transmitted by oral lore. Recovering the pipeline backlog and
deprecating this pipeline took months and from six to a dozen of people
depending on how you count. The company is still around, so we can also call
that project a success.</p>
<p>In both cases these projects were recognized as <em>tactical</em> endeavours. That is,
one-time feats to achieve, with a fair amount of freedom to step out of typical
company guidelines and processes.  Even though the scale and timeframe
differed. What made both these critical topics click was not the technology,
but the team dynamics. We made some internal presentations for these, but I
also wanted to share a bit to the outside world how I approach these projects.
This article discusses my <em>recipe</em> to tactical projects.</p>
<h1 id="a-recipe-to-approach-tactical-projects">A recipe to approach tactical projects</h1>
<p>I wrote a couple of Twitter threads relating how I approach these tactical
projects. A first <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1329847102843838466">lengthy thread</a>
discusses briefly my <em>checklist</em> and then motivates some items. The checklist gives you <strong>a set of tools</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasdicioccio/status/1340257658121691136">follow up thread</a> is much shorter and stresses the approach and the importance of giving boundaries more than instructions. This approach gives you <strong>a set of behaviours</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ll get through the checklist, discuss key behaviours to foster, and elaborate more.</p>
<h2 id="a-checklist-of-communication-tools">A checklist of communication tools</h2>
<p>Successful projects require communication. If we stretch a bit, all the tools
from the checklist I am about to give are about communication. Indeed,
successful require communication. Communicating efficiently is hard because
abundant communication is noisy, you cannot just fix communication issues with
more communication but with <em>better</em> communication. In tactical projects, I
believe that better means <em>intentional</em> communication.</p>
<p>Here is the checklist</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="book">📖</span> one jargon-doc to map concepts
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="calendar">📆</span> one periodic-meetings doc
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="libra">♎</span> one open-point/arbitrage doc
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="raising_hand">🙋</span> one communication channel for people
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="robot">🤖</span> one dump channel for robots
</li>
<li><span class="emoji" data-emoji="point_left">👈</span> one main-doc which links to all the other docs
</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the item are prescriptive. The specific tool but typically you want
online editable tools (GoogleDocs, Confluence, Notion, etc.). Pick the ones you
are familiar with.</p>
<h2 id="in-depth-review-of-the-checklist-items">In depth review of the checklist items</h2>
<p>This section just dives deeper in each topic.</p>
<h3 id="the-jargon-document">the jargon document</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tribal knowledge is bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oftentimes multiple concepts hide behind a same term because they overlap, same word != same meaning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans have a tendency to be shy, for instance, they won’t dare asking what an acronym or a keyword means because they are new to the company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you do not want a glossary, you want a Rosetta stone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJpqpAxFFoViP9XEDwKRzm1Od1g6w9DtwYTDzlMkwQs/edit?usp=sharing">example spreadsheet</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-periodic-meetings-doc">the periodic-meetings doc</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have a template for a meeting for recurring topic du jour typically: ongoing topics/blockers/HRs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at end of meeting, prepare an entry for the next meeting with the template</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>often review the template</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assign names to people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people should be encouraged to pre-fill the doc before meetings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep growing the doc until it becomes unbearably slow (ctrl+F on a topic, on a date, on a person has likely a better UX and performance than anything else)</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-pointarbitrage">open-point/arbitrage</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>many decisions must be taken, software architecture, de-prioritizing some key bug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the leader must be able to judge, motivate her decision, and record by stressing-out the decision made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage people to submit new open-points, link to them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>useful to have a table of content to quickly see what has been decided yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vuImyR-qNiZ4GEoyAhgUts1PkrQYYRnvLD5IvvSa-0/edit?usp=sharing">example open-points document</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-communication-channel-for-people">one communication channel for people</h3>
<ul>
<li>have a chat with <em>all the stakeholder</em>
</li>
<li>avoid multiplying chats because it encourages cross-talks
</li>
<li>people are used to have dozens of channel but do not force them
</li>
<li>mostly breaks Ctrl-F
</li>
<li>exceptions are if you have regulatory requirements (e.g., some info must stay more confidential), but for this, private chats probably are a better venue as they feel more transient
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-communication-channel-for-robots">one communication channel for robots</h3>
<ul>
<li>an key exception to the above rule are automation and robots (CI is breaking, alerts and notificaitons)
</li>
<li>they pollute
</li>
<li>a good way for your tech-team to decompress, share memes that would be borderline in the main communication channel
</li>
<li>you can invite non-tech if they are power-user enough or if they know how to keep calm when they see scary words like ‘alert messages’
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-main-doc-which-links-all-the-other-docs">one main-doc which links all the other docs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the checklist is rather narrow, you may need other docs (pre-existing specifications, slides)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bookmarks UX are really bad, hard to share, people are not familiar with the tools (unlike your shared doc tool)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each time a link or document pops, add an entry to the doc, the entry should have a catchy title (see jargon, the title will become the de-facto name for the doc among the team)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bang that rule on people’s head, nudge them towards making this doc their only bookmark</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not over organize until you have some acute need, again, ctrl+F will do wonders, especially if docs have catchy names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>content can be a simple table like the one below</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="master-doc-example">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>doc</td>
      <td>description</td>
      <td>link</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>periodic notes</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>link</td>

    <td>jargon</td>
    <td>all the terms explained</td>
    <td>link</td>

    <td>arbitrage</td>
    <td>all the open/closed difficult points</td>
    <td>link</td>

    <td>to report on incident</td>
    <td>link</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h1 id="behavioral-aspects">Behavioral aspects</h1>
<h2 id="the-maestro-analogy">The maestro analogy</h2>
<ul>
<li>people will have various instrument: some play brass whereas some others play strings
</li>
<li>people will have various styles: some play jazz, some prefer classical, you may need them to play modern chamber music
</li>
<li>as a lead you have one key role: set the tempo
</li>
<li>you must ensure they tune-in, you do not know how they should play but you know how it should sound
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ceremonies">Ceremonies</h2>
<ul>
<li>no fixed ceremony will solve your problems
</li>
<li>the main benefit I find to ceremonies are their agenda-locking power: people have no excuse to miss them
</li>
<li>typically you will need some frequent meeting to go through the periodic-meeting notes
</li>
<li>daily may be too strict, weekly to slow
</li>
<li>you set the tempo, so you should adapt depending on the pace, the urgency, and the delivery you expect (it happened that we made one meeting every other week, whereas sometimes as deadlines or key delivery approach we meet twice a day or assemble in the same place and pair)
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directing-with-boundaries">Directing with boundaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>people sincerely hate micro-management, seriously
</li>
<li>you won’t have the luxury to review everything and will need to cut corners, eroding your faith in the “trust but verify” adage
</li>
<li>I prefer “set the boundary and trust”
</li>
<li>you must learn how to direct with boundaries
<ul>
<li>explain some key behavior or invariants that you can verify in your systems
</li>
<li>motivate, and rephrase them, formally and informally (e.g., the zorgulino criterion is that all time you make a change, you need to see only diffs in the positive direction in the all-accounts total; this value is non-decreasing of version numbers etc.)
</li>
<li>repeat them often, even when validating someone (e.g. “you are correct, looks like your implementation idea meets the zorgulino criterion, I trust you for the details”)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
