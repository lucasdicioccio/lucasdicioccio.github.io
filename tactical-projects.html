Time-window was pretty short and resource required economical.</p>
<p>In the same company a few years before I was required to fix a pressing issue
that could lead to severe financial liability. Business-rules were lost, system
was blocked.</p>
<p>Even though the scale and timeframe differed. What made both these critical
topics click was not the technology, but the team dynamics.</p>

<p>Documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>one jargon-doc to map concepts
</li>
<li>one periodic-meetings doc
</li>
<li>an open-point/arbitrage doc
</li>
<li>a communication channel for people, another one for bots
</li>
<li>one master-doc which links to all the other docs
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical ceremony.</p>
<ul>
<li>no fixed ceremony
</li>
<li>typically need some frequent (daily may be too strict, weekly to slow, adapt depending on the pace and urgency)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Team and technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>people will naturally specialize on sub-parts of the project
</li>
<li>it’s okay to live with low bus factor
</li>
<li>set boundaries: key design invariants, and vague goals
</li>
<li>be intransigent on the boundaries
</li>
<li>do with what the team knows
</li>
<li>set the tempo, emulation and resting are both important
</li>
<li>avoid forcing new patterns/tools on people who are here to help
</li>
<li>better (e.g., setting boundaries) to compensate for the flaws you foresee
</li>
<li>request external help for background improvement (e.g., running in the new kube cluster rather than on VMs)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a third-party external judge (e.g., auditors for financial topics, lawyers for specific regulations) they are good as they reduce decision paralysis around ‘good-enough’
</li>
</ul>
