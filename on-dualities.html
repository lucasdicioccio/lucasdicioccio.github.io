Not to
get rid of concepts, rather to re-interpret them from simpler components. I
achieved some level of programming-zen when recognizing that most of our work
as programmers and computer engineers is re-interpreting a variant of the same
handful of connectors between things. I do not claim that this take is
particularly novel, on the opposite I’ve seen the same argument re-hashed.
However the context was never great and some people justify that if two things
are the same then they are equivalent.  Thankfully, I look at this aspect of my
work with philosophy: we re-interpret the same handful of concepts but each
have a panel of use-cases that makes them interesting in their own.</p>
<p>Our job is to balance out complexity. Decision paralisis can be real.  Learning
to recognize dual concepts is important to make the right tradeoffs, and hence
the right technical choices.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>A situation of duality is when two concepts cohabit well while in opposition,
they connect and perform some symmetrical dance. Like the Yin and Yang: the
existence of the Yin justifies and coincides with the existence of the Yang.</p>
<p>For instance, the two sides of an equality <code>a = b</code> are in a dual relationship:
what happens to <code>a</code> requires a commensurate opposite thing on <code>b</code>. Such is the
law of the equality.  For inequalities <code>a &lt;= b</code> the existence of the duality is
more subtle. For instance, in physics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heinseberg’s uncertainty principle</a> is the realization that some duality
between position and momentum (velocity) exists.  There is an indirection
though: some intermediate space exists between the terms <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of the
inequality, and it’s what happens to the “sides” of this space which are
symmetric. Another way to say it is that the duality manifests itself only in
some zone of operation (for Heisenberg, this operating zone concerns
infenitesimal amounts of accuracy). What is important here is that you may not
realize some duality exists because you always operate far from a boundary,
like humans did for millenia before Heinsenberg. Circumstances may lead you
to this zone, and finding the Yin and the Yang is illuminating.</p>
<p>More important, you may not need to recognize that two concepts exist in a
duality for the duality to exist. You may completely miss.</p>
<h1>The producer-consumer duality</h1>
<p>New behaviours typically are backward compatible.
New behaviours typically are backward incompatible.</p>
<p>Writing a library is being a producer of code, writing an application is being a consumer of code.</p>
<h2>Sum types and Product types</h2>
<pre><code>data Bool = False | True
data Bool ~= False + True
</code></pre>
<pre><code>data Branch = Pair CodeA CodeB
data Branch ~= CodeA x CodeB
</code></pre>
<p>Thus if you <em>produce a product type</em> you can have a <em>multiple independent consumers</em> (e.g., two parallel and non-interfering pieces of logic than can both run).
Conversely if you <em>produce a sum type</em> well-behaved code must have <em>one branch per alternative</em> (i.e., two pieces of logic which are mutually exclusive).</p>
<p>Squinting a bit, we realize that a producer which produces <code>product type</code> objects asks for a <code>sum of consumers</code>. Whereas a producer of <code>sum type</code> objects forces a <code>product of consumers</code>.</p>
<p>Formally we can introduce some notations to help discuss more rigorously about
this topic.  Let’s write <code>f: _ -&gt; A</code> for <strong><code>f</code> is a producer of <code>A</code></strong> and <code>g: B -&gt; _</code> for <strong><code>g</code> is a consumer of <code>B</code></strong>. Thus we could write <code>h: X -&gt; Y</code> to say
that <strong><code>h</code> consumes X to produce <code>Y</code></strong>. You may recognize the function type
notation.</p>
<p>Then if we want to feed <code>g</code> with the result of <code>f</code> then the equality <code>A = B</code>
must hold to say that <strong><code>g</code> consumes what <code>f</code> produces</strong>. Now, let’s study what
happens when <code>A</code> is a sum type <code>A = (alternative_1 | alternative_2) = B</code> .</p>
<pre><code>                ---&gt; alternative_1 --- [   ]
               /                       |   |
  o ---[ f ]---                        | g |---- o
               \                       |   |
                ---&gt; alternative_2 --- [   ]
</code></pre>
<h2>Importance</h2>
<p>This duality is important in modeling and technical aspects of the code.
In short: you can trade some control-flow complexity into some data complexity.</p>
<h3>code with bunch of nested ifs</h3>
<p>A series of conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize the number of branches you have in total
</li>
<li>write a type with these many branches
</li>
<li>map your context (set of variables) onto this type
</li>
<li>flatten the conditions
</li>
</ul>
<h3>data pipelines</h3>
<p>We often need to integrate diverse data sources and give them a similar shape
(e.g., survey from past year and this year, with slightly different fields).</p>
<p>You can recognize two data sources as being a product (e.g., when you have alternative choices for a user identifier, you want a subset of total information) or a sum type (e.g., you need the union of the dataset).</p>
<h3>recognizing when to use or work-around so-called abstract code</h3>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you have interfaces code to “normalize” access
</li>
<li>the idea is to write an abstract piece of logic and let adapters provide implementations
</li>
<li>other pieces of interface code may use these as input too
</li>
<li>however the use of such interface-specific intermediary lead to braided-code, the original output is insufficient, so you still need carry the original objects, you end up adding code to undo features
</li>
</ul>
<h3>refactoring technique: switching representations</h3>
<p>Rather than providing a sum type as output, you can encode the possible branches as handlers.</p>
<p>Same thing, when you have code that requires callbacks, you could modify it to produce an intermediary structure.</p>
<p>Tradeoffs are opposite: extra structures typically require more RAM but you can inspect and print them. Whereas function calls requier less RAM but cannot provide as much debug information.</p>
<h3>auditing the importance of introducing new edge cases</h3>
<p>We could consider what happens when <code>A = B</code> is relaxed into <code>A &lt;= B</code> or <code>A &gt;= B</code>, that
would bring us to Liskov substitution principle, variance and covariance. You
can treat the <code>A &gt;= B</code> case by saying that extra-alternatives need extra branches.</p>
<h3>monoliths, microservices, and IT-system architectures</h3>
<p>We assumed so far that <code>A -&gt; B</code> was a function like a Python or Java function.
We can actually think of <code>-&gt;</code> as a many data-transfer mechanisms: remote procedure calls, HTTP queries, task message, SQL queries.</p>
<p>So now if you have a service that produces objects with two possible shapes <code>A or B</code>, you know the consumers will require pairs of branches.</p>
<p>Similarly, you could have a pair of services (e.g., archived-orders and fresh-orders), possibly with different data-format. Your website will thus either need to uniformize.</p>
<p>In short, the sum-product dualities will severely leak into the data-access patterns of your services.</p>
<h1>Other dualities</h1>
<h2>null vs. default</h2>
<p>Much has been written about <code>null</code> being the billion-dollar error.
Well, my belief if we should regard <code>defaults</code> with the same horror, because
default values are the dual of null values.</p>
<h2>push vs. pull</h2>
<p>With evented architectures being trendy, people tend to oversell the power of
push-based architectures over pull-based. However there is a dual tension
between the two.</p>
<p>Push is write and Pull is read.</p>
<p>Some work are inherently push-based: everything that has a sum as input (e.g., two operations that may occur).</p>
<p>Some work are inherently pull-based: everything that requires a product as input (e.g., consensus to know the true value, when debugging you need a product of dataset to recreate a full context).</p>
<p>Thus, no big surprise, push-based architecture actually are full of pull-based
mechanisms.</p>
